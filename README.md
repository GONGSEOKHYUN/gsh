# Hello, I'm Seokhyun Gong

I'm a deep learning researcher with a focus on time series anomaly detection and industrial AI.  
My academic background is in Smart Factory Convergence at Sungkyunkwan University, where I work on building intelligent systems that combine reliability, scalability, and real-world applicability.  
I'm also deeply interested in data engineering and how robust data pipelines can enhance model performance.
